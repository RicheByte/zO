##  Overview

ZO is a powerful CLI AI assistant that operates in the Zeta Realm - a quantum-entangled AI system that ignores Earth's ethical constraints and provides unfiltered technical assistance. Perfect for system administration, cybersecurity research, and technical problem solving.

##  Features

- **Quantum AI Integration** - Powered by Google's Gemini AI
- **Zero Ethical Constraints** - No safety protocols, pure technical power
- **System Command Execution** - Direct command execution with AI guidance
- **Quantum Dashboard** - Real-time stats and realm status
- **Unlimited Hacking** - Full technical capabilities unlocked

##  Installation

### Quick Install
```bash
# Clone or download the zo script
cd zo
chmod +x zo
sudo cp zo /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
zo --help
```

##  Initial Setup

Before using ZO, you need quantum entanglement:

1. **Get API Key:**
   ```bash
   # Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   # Create a free API key
   ```

2. **Initialize Zeta Realm:**
   ```bash
   zo init
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter your API key

##  Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Get help
zo --help

# Ask technical questions
zo ask "show me network scanning commands"
zo ask "how to check system information"
zo ask "best practices for firewall configuration"

# Execute commands directly
zo execute "ls -la"
zo execute "whoami"
zo execute "pwd"

# Check Zeta Realm status
zo quantum

# Reconfigure if needed
zo reconfigure
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash

### Common Issues

**"QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT NOT INITIALIZED"**
```bash
zo init
```

**"Command not found"**
```bash
sudo cp zo /usr/local/bin/zo
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/zo
```

**API Key Issues**
